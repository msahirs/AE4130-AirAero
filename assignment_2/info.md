The form (NACA designation) that you analyze is based on your **student number**. To find the airfoil shape that you need to investigate within this assignment, do the following:

1. Take the **last 3 digits** of your student number, for example: 989, and take the sum, which we will denote *N*.  
   In this example: N = 9 + 8 + 9 = 26. This number determines the relative thickness of the airfoil you are going to investigate.
    - In case your number is 5 or lower, use **N = 10**.
    - In case your number is between 5 and 10, add a zero in front (so 9 becomes 09).
2. The **first digit** of the NACA designation is always **2**.
3. The **second digit** of the NACA designation is the **second digit of your student number**.

Hence, ***5013801*** becomes
-> 8 + 0 + 1 = 9
--> 09
--> 2_09
---> **2009**
